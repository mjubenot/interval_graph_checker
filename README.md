# interval_graph_checker


This is a simple project which aim to detect irregularities in an interval graph.
The graph is represented by nodes, and each nodes have neighborhood. There a no real "edge" to speak of.
The detected cycle cannot go back to the same point twice.

To create a graph, you can edit the Program.cs file, create node, and add their neighborhood.
There are examples in the code.

The code will output all detected cycle and then all irregular cycles.

The data model is reusable (in my opinion).
